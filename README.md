# OpenTimelineIO Kdenlive Adapter

This repository contains the OpenTimelineIO adapter for the Kdenlive file format (`*.kdenlive`). It is distributed under the MIT License.

# ATTENTION!!! REPOSITORY IN PREPERATION PHASE

At the moment the Kdenlive adapter is still part of the OpenTimelineIO core. To be installed via `python -m pip install opentimelineio` there is a ongoing efford to split all adapters from the core. As part of this the Kdenlive adapter will move here and get his own pypi.org python package soon.

## What is Kdenlive?

[Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org) is a Free and Open Source video editing application, based on MLT Framework and KDE Frameworks.

In case you are looking for the source code of Kdenlive, it is here: https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive

## What is OpenTimelineIO?

[OpenTimelineIO](https://opentimeline.io) is an interchange format and API for editorial cut information. OTIO contains information about the order and length of cuts and references to external media. It is not however, a container format for media.

For integration with applications, the [core OTIO library](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO) is implemented in C++ the project also supports an official python binding. The python binding includes a plugin system which supports a number of different types of plugins, most notably adapters (like this one).

### Adapter Plugins

To provide interoperability with other file formats or applications lacking a native integration, the opentimelineio community has built a number of python adapter plugins. Beside Kdenlive this includes Final Cut Pro XML, AAF, CMX 3600 EDL, and more.

For more information about this, including supported formats, see: https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/adapters.html

A list of tools and projects using OpenTimelineIO can be found [here](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/wiki/Tools-and-Projects-Using-OpenTimelineIO).

## Installing

**ATTENTION: THIS SECTION IS NOT YET VALID, see note on top of this document**

As a user you can usually just install the adapter through the Kdenlive user interface or directly from pypi.org with this command

```bash
python -m pip install otio-kdenlive-adapter
```

## Development

The OpenTimelineIO documentation can be found here: https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io

### Testing the plugin during development
```bash
# In the root folder of the repo
pip install -e .

# Test an adapter for instance
otioconvert -i some_timeline.otio -o some_timeline.kdenlive
```

The OpenTimelineIO documentation can be found here: https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io

### Unit tests

It's always a good idea to write unit tests for you code.
Please provide tests that run against supported versions of python and OpenTimelineIO.

To run the unit tests do
```bash
# In the root folder of the repo
pytest
```
